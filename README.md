# web-component
An opinionated boilerplate generator for creating web components.

# purpose
To save myself some typing.

# TODO
- [ ] Make the steps (directory creation, template copying, template processing) async, probably leveraging promises, to be more like the cool kids.
- [ ] README template (using the webcomponents boilerplate as a start)
- [ ] bower integration. I know nothing about bower, but that's what everybody seems to be using for their components.
